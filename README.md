## Requirements

You will need a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that you have administrative privileges on, and need some specific software packages installed:


**On your machine**
- the Bash shell; you should only have to set this up if you are using a Windows machine, following the [Software Carpentry setup instructions](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup)
- Git [installed](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) and [configured](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html) on your local machine
- Python 3.x; we recommend installing [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
- a text editor, preferably one designed for writing code; we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) if you haven't chosen one.

**In the browser**
- You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to participate in the school. Make sure you have your [github authentication](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account) set up as well. 
- Sign in to the school's Zulip instance to communicate with students and instructors throughout the course: https://urssi-softwareschool.zulipchat.com

Specific Python packages (install with pip or conda)
[TODO: DETERMINE DEPENDENCIES]

## Projects

Most of your work time will be spent on an individual project where you develop a research software package.
You are expected to come with idea or some basis for a project.

Ideally, this should be something that supports your work and that you would (or could) continue developing or using after the winter school.
We hope that most—or at least some—of the projects will eventually be submitted to the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org), which we'll briefly talk about on the final day.

## Reimbursements

Please follow the instructions you will receive over email and reach out to Madicken Munk with any questions or concerns.

## Feedback 

TBD
