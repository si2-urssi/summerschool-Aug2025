## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a [code of conduct](https://github.com/si2-urssi/summerschool-Aug2025/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the URSSI Summer School and all associated spaces, both physical and digital. Please review this.

## Instructors

[Madicken Munk](https://github.com/munkm) is an Assistant Professor in the School of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Oregon State University. Previously, she was a postdoc at the University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications where she was a maintainer and release manager of yt, a visualization package for simulation data. 
[Brigitta Sipőcz](https://github.com/bsipocz) is a Research Software Engineer at Caltech/IPAC at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive. She has a research astronomy background and she is a maintainer for various astronomy Python libraries. She propaply cares way too much about tooling and infrastructure with a keen interest on solving CI/CD challenges of executable tutorial content.

## Requirements

You will need a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that you have administrative privileges on, and need some specific software packages installed:


**On your machine**
- the Bash shell; you should only have to set this up if you are using a Windows machine, following the [Software Carpentry setup instructions](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup)
- Git [installed](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#installing-git) and [configured](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html) on your local machine to attribute commits to you and your email address. Note for windows users: if you do not already have git set up locally, you can choose either git bash or installing the windows subsystem for linux. Both install options are included in the link above. 
- Github SSH keys set up. You will need this to be able to push/pull from 
github with git on your local machine. If you prefer to use https and already
have that configured, that's fine. You can find out more about 
[creating](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and setting up 
ssh keys for your github account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). 
- Python 3.x; we recommend installing [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) to manage the dependencies you'll be using in this school. Some lessons will require additional dependencies that you'll install during the course. 
- a text editor, preferably one designed for writing code. Instructors in this school use emacs, vim, and vscode. Choose something you are comfortable with. 

**In the browser**
- You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to participate in the school. Make sure you have your [github authentication](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account) set up as well. Note that we do understand that you may choose to use other git hosting options, such as gitlab. We will be instructing lessons through github because of its current ubiquity in the ecosystem, but you are welcome to continue your software work outside of the school with whichever tools you prefer. 
- Sign in to the school's Zulip instance to communicate with students and instructors throughout the course: https://urssi-softwareschool.zulipchat.com

Specific Python packages will be installed during lessons throughout the school.

## Projects

Most of your work time will be spent on an individual project where you develop a research software package.
You are expected to come with idea or some basis for a project.

Ideally, this should be something that supports your work and that you would (or could) continue developing or using after the summer school.
We hope that most—or at least some—of the projects will eventually be submitted to the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org), which we'll briefly talk about on the final day.

## Reimbursements

Please follow the instructions you will receive over email and reach out to Madicken Munk with any questions or concerns.
